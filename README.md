# SECP1513-Technology-and-Information-System
Reflection of course

The Technlogy and Information System course has introduced various aspects of information systems yet the definition and types of information systems. During design thinking, the innovation skills and problem solving concepts has greatly been improved. Also, it helps in the focus of definning problem and generating creative solution. Thus, this course is believed that has strengthen the problem-solving abilities.


# Assignment
**Assignment 1:** [Poster Industry Talk]()

**Assignment 2:** [Video Industry Visit](video_industry_visit_UTMDIGITAL.mov)

  Reflection
  
  The visit provided valuable insights into the Data Engineering course at UTM, including its structure, as explained by the speaker.Through the talk, students gained a better understanding on   how UTMDigital operates, including its services and systems.The visit and interviews provide a deeper understanding on the structure and purpose of UTMDigital systems, such as UTMPortal,         UTMSmart, and the e-learning system.Overall,the visit to UTMDigital provided a well-rounded experience, combining academic and practical knowledge. It helped students understand the course       better, sparked their interest in the field, and prepared them for real-world applications

**Assignment 3:** [Report Industry Talk](https://liveutm-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/nurfaatihah_live_utm_my/EVROrZpIo15CmMOLzOqmPmMB6A7CBrnVIVHSIrMh9Cetmw?e=xNy41c).

  Reflection
  
  The industry talk provide a simple recognization to the students on the industry application of computer science. This exposure allowed students to connect theoretical knowledge with real-        world applications. Useful skills and meaningful advise are provided during the sharings. Through this talk, the shared experienced and knowledge gained had motivated the new learners to move    formard with more passion and motion.

**Assignment 4: Technical Paper IEEE Format**

**PC Assemble**

  Reflection
  
  The lab involve the installation of computer Central Processing Unit(CPU). It provide a chance of learning parts of CPU and ways to set up the CPU in correctly and effectively. Wth the success of implementation of the CPU brings a good learning experience of computer assemble.

  Reflection
  
  Design thinking improve in more understanding innovation and problem-solving concepts. It helps in finding out user’s need, defining problems, ideating solution, prototyping and testing. These concepts and technique are essential for innovation and program develop. It also helps  to focus on problem definition and generate creative solutions. This strengthened problem-solving abilities.
